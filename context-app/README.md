# Context-app 

```sh
React.context allows you to directly pass props to reciever,

If a n-th child needs data from root node then props needs
to be passed from root to n-th child while intermediate nodes 
has no use of the props and thus acting as tunnel to the pass props.

With React.context There is Context provider & consumer which
eleminates props tunneling by directly passing props to to required node.
